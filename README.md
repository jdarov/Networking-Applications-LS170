# LS170 – Internet Networking Foundations

Welcome to my repository for **LS170 – NETWORK APPLICATIONS*, a core course in the Launch School curriculum. This course dives deep into the **protocols, architecture, and evolution of the internet**, building foundational networking knowledge every serious software developer needs.

---

## 🧠 What This Course Covers

This repo documents my work, notes, and challenges for all 6 LS170 modules:

1. **The Internet** – Physical and logical structure of the internet, ISPs, backbone networks, routing, and protocols.
2. **The Transport Layer** – TCP/UDP, ports, packet ordering, reliability, congestion handling, and multiplexing.
3. **Intro to HTTP** – Basics of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and request/response mechanics.
4. **Working with HTTP** – Practical usage with `curl`, API requests, headers, status codes, and RESTful APIs.
5. **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** – HTTPS, SSL certificates, encryption, handshakes, and secure communications.
6. **The Evolution of Network Technologies** – From ARPANET to IPv6, mobile networks, satellite internet, and what's next.

Each module has notes, exercises, and some challenges that help apply these concepts in a practical way — all with a developer's mindset.

## 🔧 Why This Course Matters to Me as a Developer

Modern software **lives on the network**. Whether you're building a web app, mobile app, IoT device, or API backend, you're designing for a world of connections, latency, and protocols.

Here’s how LS170 sets me up for success:

- 📡 **Better Debugging** – I’ll understand DNS failures, connection resets, and server errors from the bottom up.
- 🛠 **DevOps Collaboration** – Speak the same language as sysadmins, cloud engineers, and security professionals.
- 🔐 **Secure Development** – Write apps that **encrypt, authenticate, and protect** data correctly.
- ⚙️ **API Mastery** – Know how and why `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, and TLS requests work — not just how to write them.
- 💬 **Team Contributor** – I can design, document, and defend networking choices in team projects.

This repo is my personal blueprint for learning the stuff under the hood that separates coders from engineers.
